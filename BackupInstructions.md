# How to Manually Back Up Your Data

It is recommended to periodically back up your bookkeeping data to a safe, separate location like a USB thumb drive. This protects your information in case something happens to your computer.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Plug in your USB Drive:** Make sure your USB thumb drive is connected to the computer and appears in File Explorer.
2.  **Locate the Database File:** The application data is stored in a file named `therapist_bookkeeping.db`. This file should be located in the same folder as the application (`TherapyBookkeeper.exe`).
3.  **Copy the Database File:**
    *   Right-click on the `therapist_bookkeeping.db` file.
    *   Select "Copy".
4.  **Paste to USB Drive:**
    *   Open your USB drive in File Explorer.
    *   Right-click in an empty space inside the USB drive folder.
    *   Select "Paste".
5.  **Verify:** You should now see a copy of `therapist_bookkeeping.db` on your USB drive.
6.  **Eject Safely:** Remember to safely eject the USB drive before unplugging it.

**Recommendation:** Do this backup regularly, perhaps once a week or after significant data entry sessions.
